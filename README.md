# NJ_Farm_Fruits
Cleaner version of the process of pulling data from 2022 NJ Agriculture Census.
This website has an incredible amount of data from the 2022 and 2017 New Jersey Agriculture Census.
The inability to find where the data is hosted, along with very odd formatting in the text file made this interesting.
This repository will be the notes and code of how I used Python (myplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy) to build graphs to easily absorb the data.
