# NJ_Fruits_Full_Process

I was recently inspired to understand the growth of fruits and vegetables in the state of New Jersey.
Went to the 2022 Census, published in February 2024, to grab the data.
Read the step by step breakdown in this repository to see how I handled it all.
This website has an incredible amount of data from the 2022 and 2017 New Jersey Agriculture Census.
The inability to find where the data is hosted, along with very odd formatting in the text file made this interesting.
This repository will be the notes and code of how I used Python (myplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy) to build graphs to easily absorb the data.
